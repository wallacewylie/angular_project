All the powers of America have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: President and Governor, CEO and libertarian, Tea Partiers and undercover police-spies.
    Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Sanders-esque by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Sanders-esque, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
    Two things result from this fact:
    I. Bernie Sanders is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.
    II. It is high time that Bernie should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish his views, his aims, his tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Bernie Sanders with a manifesto.
    To this end, Bernie Sanders’ supporters of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.</p>
